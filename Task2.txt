AxionRay Data Analyst Assessment - Task 2 Report

a. Column Analysis
The dataset contains 52 columns and a few hundred rows. Key column-level observations include:



Many other columns were identifiers (e.g., dealer, platform, transmission) with moderate variability. Some columns like `CAMPAIGN_NBR` had a high percentage of missing values and were dropped during cleaning.


b. Data Cleaning Summary

Steps performed:

* **Missing values**: Filled nulls in text fields with "unknown" and numerical fields with median values. Dropped columns with >60% missing values (e.g., `CAMPAIGN_NBR`).
* **Column normalization**: Standardized all column names to lowercase and stripped whitespace to avoid access errors.
* **Categorical cleanup**: Removed inconsistent capitalization and whitespace in fields like `dealer_name`, `platform`, and `engine_desc`.
* **Outlier handling**: Identified extreme values in `km` and `totalcost` using box plots. Most were retained after confirming they reflected rare but valid cases.



c. Visualizations

1. Top Causal Parts
   Bar plot showing the top 10 most frequently occurring failed components (e.g., battery, steering sensor).

2. Customer Complaint Word Cloud
   Visual representation of most common terms in customer complaints. Common themes included "noise", "steering", "brake", and "vibration".

3. Repair Cost Distribution
   Histogram of `totalcost` values, showing that most repairs are low-cost, with a long tail of high-cost repairs.



d. Generated Tags & Key Takeaways

Generated Tags:
From `customer_verbatim` and `correction_verbatim`, tags were generated using keyword extraction for:

* `symptom_component`
* `fix_component`
